*Review Preview*

*“The Gulag”* site is a virtual museum built around a complete 3D tour of a Gulag camp illustrated by the testimonies of survivors, literary excerpts and a tour of authentic objects and documents.  The victims of the Soviet Gulag were not only from the nations of the USSR but were also citizens of other countries – Czechoslovaks, Poles, Hungarians, Frenchmen, Americans, and others. Political prisoners suffered the most because, on top of the brutal hard labour conditions and the despotism of guards, they were terrorised by criminal prisoners. Historians estimate the total number of Gulag prisoners at 15-18 million, of whom at least 1.5 million did not survive their incarceration. With the site being made by chief coordinator Štěpán Černoušek, it was inspired by bibliographies and basic texts on the history of the Gulag and Soviet repression. The main feature of the site includes an interactive map showing Gulag sites throughout Europe and Asia. I was inspired to do this project based on my experience with the Gulag in Activision’s Call of Duty: Warzone. This game features a deathmatch in an open Russian map with the Gulag being a final head to head deathmatch to get back in the game. This site has given me a new perspective on what the Gulag really was and what it entailed back in the mid 1900s.

*Review Design*

Gulag Online’s content and features make up for the sub par design. The main feature includes the interactive map that sits to the left of the screen. The map illustrates the geographic extent of Soviet repression. This geographic layout also allows for switching between various layers – for instance, satellite images or detailed military maps. The site seems like it's still in the early stages of its full potential. The expansion plan includes more expeditions to abandoned Gulag camps, the incorporation of further stories and survivors and the supplementing of the interactive map, both with more mapped locations and a database of data from individual Gulag camp administrations. In addition to the map, Gulag Online offers a dashboard to the right containing a People, Places, Items, and Articles tab to give easy access to users and finding specific information in specific time periods. 
 
*Review Relevance and Findings*

While Gulag Online’s interactive site is very interesting and informative, there can be many critiques given to this site. First of all the site is unsecure. This can give users the wrong impression that it is an unsafe and unreliable place to get information and they might want to look elsewhere. Along with this, the site link itself is weird and unorganized, with no .org or .com, or any reference that it is an informational site for that matter. Despite the layout of the site being useful for the information it entails, they could have done a much better job design wise. The project is basic with white bland tabs and fonts throughout in an unorganized configuration, giving users the wrong impression of the importance and intelligence that is contained within. Overall the site is laggy with slow loading screens, with the map being the most difficult to use and navigate. Although it may not be the most user friendly place to be, I still found comfort within the dashboard tabs with easy navigation to People, Places, Items, and Articles with pictures next to for easier use. Gulag Online’s strong suit is definitely geographical, with camps being easily accessible to find locations, as well as detailed descriptions about each, especially the labour camps in Ukraine, which there were many of. The project has many advantages and disadvantages but overall it's a good informational site.

*Review Credit*

The project credit goes to Štěpán Černoušek the chief coordinator, as well as Radek Světlík, Josef Brošta, and Jan Vrátný for field research and visualization.  It is a project of the Gulag.cz association, whose activities include mapping and documenting abandoned camps in the former USSR. They are partnered with the Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes, which as part of its research tracks the fates of Czechoslovak citizens persecuted in the USSR. The establishment of the museum has been financed by the support of the public on the Hithit website and the Vodafone Foundation’s Technology for the Future program. The gulag.cz association can be found and contacted through Facebook, Instagram, Youtube, and Twitter. 
 
*Review Summary*

The Gulag Project made by Štěpán Černoušek was an impressive and entertaining one, especially since it was made by foreign creators and the site is an English. Throughout the site interface I learned a lot more about Russian history as well as features of several Gulag camps and expanded my knowledge beyond just a video game. Overall the site can be improved by the design features by a longshot, as well as site security and brand, but in the end that's not the goal of the project. Gulag Online offers many interactive features to a broad audience of users who want to learn more about the USSR in the mid 1900s and the features of what the “Gulag” entailed.
