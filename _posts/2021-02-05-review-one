**Review Preview**

	Six Degrees of Francis Bacon is a digital project created by Cristopher Warren, and a team of scholars and researchers at Carnegie Mellon University. This site was completely redid to offer a better presentation of all works included, easy access to students and scholars all over the world, and to create one digital interactive place where works can be added, cited, and shared. This infinite-like network contains the research and social networks of early modern Britain, from 1500-1700. Francis Bacon was a lord chancellor, politician, and philosopher; as well as the main theme of the humanistic site. While this site was created mainly for this purpose of research and knowledge, it also signifies key aspects of modern digital humanities. This includes contexts of data visualization, crowdsourcing, user experience, and graphic design.

**Review Design** 

	The Six Degrees project highlights the major features of its redesign. The site was developed with Density Design Lab from Politecnico di Milano, and to test its functionalities. The desired results are to be as followed: a new presentation and new features of the Six Degrees of Francis Bacon and total redesign; Medium-volume user testing; and finally a  richer picture of the networks and groups of early modern Britain. Mainly, the SDFB Network is utilized for the network interface of the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. However, there is different code that runs the web application which supports this collaborative digital reconstruction. It is made up of a Ruby on Rails backend (a set of API endpoints that communicate with a Postgres database), and an AngularJS frontend. Included in the Angular code is a set of D3js network visualizations. The code is split into modularized chunks for easy reuse. http://sixdegreesoffrancisbacon.com/about

**Review Relevance and Findings**

	If there was ever a perfect example of digital humanities, this project site would come close. The Oxford Languages definition of Digital Humanities: “An area of scholarly activity at the intersection of computing or digital technologies and the disciplines of the humanities. It includes the systematic use of digital resources in the humanities, as well as the analysis of their application”. What could be a better example of this than the Six Degrees of Francis Bacon? The articulation was designed specifically for a one place organization where people from anywhere and anytime can interact with it. The site allows users to not only learn but to add their own knowledge to the never ending web, with Francis Bacon being the spider at the center. What makes this network so easy to use is the brackets connected to each person, literally like a spider web. The site uses specific nodes to keyword search for each detail about the person, connecting it to another one. For example, if you were researching King James the second, you would see that his node connects to the Quakers, a group of religious friends seeking righteous paths. From there on the Quakers connect to William Penn, establishing a connection that keeps on expanding throughout the interface, you get the idea.

**Review Credit**
	
	Most of the credit obviously has to go to the university it was founded at and sponsored by. The website is hosted by Carnegie Mellon University Libraries, with all of its founders being students and professors at the university. Official list of founders go as: Christopher Warren (Co-Founder and Director), Daniel Shore (Co-Founder and Professor), Jessica Otis (Humanities Specialist), Lawrence Wang, Mike Finegold, and Cosma Shalizi. Most of these founders have several publications in pieces they have written about Six Degrees. Furthermore, it has been presented in numerous scholarly and public venues, including the annual meetings of the American Historical Association, Modern Language Association, History of Science Society Building, and Medieval and Early Modern Networks at the University of Maryland.

**Review Summary**

	From the beginning this project was well organized and planned out. The founders at Carnegie Mellon did an excellent job creating a database about early modern Britain, while at the same time furthering and expanding the term of digital humanities.
