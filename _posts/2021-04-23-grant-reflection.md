  **Reflection**

  The grant process has been a journey. This has definitely been one of the longest and most influential papers I have written in my college career, and its not even done yet. Picking my grant topic was not easy. Throughout the course, I became very intrigued and interested by interactive maps throughout my reviews of digital humanities projects. This made me inspired to choose my grant topic of making an interactive map of Christopher Newport University.
  
 Christopher Newport University is quickly becoming a major college in Virginia. 20 years ago, it consisted of only one building, and now in present day it is one of the top campuses in the nation according to Regional Universities South. The university has grown exponentially and will continue to grow not only in a campus aspect, but in students, staff, academics, and involvement. With the creation of a project on the map of CNU’s amazing campus, people can learn why this is such a great school to attend and hopefully persuade them to enroll.
 
This grant proposal would be called the *Captain’s Atlas*. This interactive map would allow possible students, parents, staff, and anyone in general in the nation to view CNU’s campus on the site. This could be incredibly helpful to those that cannot visit the campus itself in Newport News. Especially during this global COVID-19 pandemic, traveling and viewing is much harder. Christopher Newport University will want to get as many people as possible to see the campus in an efficient manner. Not to mention this is a great way to advertise for Christopher Newport. With the site being popular, people will get to realize everything that comes with it. The creation of this map would be through ThingLink. Thing Link is a trusted partner of Microsoft Gold as well as Google Cloud. This software allows many features, with the most notable being the 360 Virtual Reality feature that would go perfect with this project. 

There are many digital humanities projects that are similar to the idea that I am proposing. For example, the university of Colorado has an interactive map of campus, just not in the 360 virtual reality. The real issue in this projects start up is money. The budget would have to be well over $1000, mostly because of the time and equipment needed to get to every inch of the campus. Still, this would be a small price to pay for such an excellent finalized product.

Writing this grant has made me more appreciative of those I have seen and studied in class all year. There is a lot of work that goes into it that people dont normally notice. It also has allowed me to show my creativity. Even though this grant will not happen, I thoroughly enjoyed thinking about every aspect of this project and writing it down because I was allowed to, it is all according to my design, nobody else's. I also enjoyed the freedom of being able to pick the projects that we reviewed throughout the semester. This allowed me to get more invested in what I was researching and made it easier translating it to paper. 

As the end of the semester draws ever closer, I can safely say I have become more knowledgeable in the field of digital humanities. Since I made digital humanities my minor, this was the first class that I took as an introduction to the study. This was mostly because I knew I could knock out a required writing intensive and a class for my minor at the same time, two birds with one stone. At first I thought digital humanities was just writing online about scholarly issues, but now I know that it is something totally different. I have come to learn it can be a lot more than that, as I have seen with my reviews, the Gulag project, and the interactive map of Christopher Newport University that I am making right now.

Digital Humanities is not a field of study to be taken lightly. My grades in this class have not been a good representation of what I wanted and it is a lot of work to keep up with. First of all GitHub was a new site to me and so was code. I did not expect me to be doing all of my writing on a coding website using markdown and linked images but here I am, 5 posts later having little to no trouble at all. Another area I struggled in was shockingly Twitter Posts. Although I enjoyed them and keeping up with the class, I could not keep up with doing them 3 times a week, and my grade has suffered because of it. I think it is a very interesting part of the class though and is a very modern way of learning and goes with the class very well.  Digital Humanities is not something you are going to understand right off the bat, it is gradual learning and understanding, and although I have learned a lot I think I am just scratching the surface of the study.
