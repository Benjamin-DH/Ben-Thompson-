**Reflection**

  The grant process has been a long journey. This has definitely been one of the longest and most influential papers I have written in my college career, and its not even done yet. Picking my grant topic was not easy. Throughout the course, I became very intrigued and interested by interactive maps throughout my reviews of digital humanites projects. This made me inspired to choose my grant topic of making an interactive map of Christopher Newport University.
 Christopher Newport University is quickly becoming a major college in Virginia. 20 years ago, it consisted of only one building, and now in present day it is one of the top campuses in the nation according to Regional Universities South. The university has grown exponentially and will continue to grow not only in a campus aspect, but in students, staff, academics, and involvement. With the creation of a project on the map of CNU’s amazing campus, people can learn why this is such a great school to attend and hopefully persuade them to enroll.
This grant proposal would be called the Captain’s Atlas. This interactive map would allow possible students, parents, staff, and anyone in general in the nation to view CNU’s campus on the site. This could be incredibly helpful to those that cannot visit the campus itself in Newport News. Especially during this global COVID-19 pandemic, traveling and viewing is much harder. Christopher Newport University will want to get as many people as possible to see the campus in an efficient manner. Not to mention this is a great way to advertise for Christoher Newport. With the site being popular, people will get to realize everything that comes with it. 
The creation of this map would be through ThingLink. Thing Link is a trusted partner of Microsoft Gold as well as Google Cloud. This software allows many features, with the most notable being the 360 Virtual Reality feature that would go perfect with this project.

 What is your project? What interests you about it?
Do you still imagine your project like you did when you first wrote your abstract?
Have you found any other DH projects that are similar to yours? How are you differentiating your project from them?
How has the process of writing a grant changed your understanding of the project as a whole?
